  "summary": "Diff adds a composed single-page GutOptim landing page with all major sections, repeated orange CTAs via a shared CtaButton, sticky header navigation with smooth scrolling, and a mobile sticky bottom CTA bar. However, it also introduces Internet Identity/auth-related hooks and provider wiring (a stated non-goal / immutable-path constraint), and includes unrequested footer attribution/disclaimer content. Mobile safe-area handling is referenced but not evidenced as implemented in CSS.",

      "requirement": "Sticky mobile bottom “Buy Now” bar should include appropriate spacing/safe-area handling so it doesn’t obstruct key content.",
      "reason": "MobileStickyCtaBar uses a `safe-area-bottom` class, but no corresponding utility/style is shown in the provided CSS, so safe-area handling is not evidenced as implemented.",
