## Summary
**Goal:** Create a single-page, premium, conversion-focused GutOptim affiliate landing page with consistent styling, repeated orange CTAs, smooth anchor navigation, and provided section images.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a clean, modern single-page layout (white base with soft mint/teal accents, sans-serif typography, rounded cards, soft shadows, spacious spacing).
- Add a sticky header with text logo “GutOptim”, anchor menu (Benefits, How It Works, Reviews, FAQ) with smooth scrolling, and an orange “Buy Now” button linking to https://gutoptim24.com/text.php#aff=Nexora_8248.
- Implement the Hero section with the exact provided headline/subheadline, 3 trust bullets with icons, a prominent orange CTA to the affiliate URL, and the provided hero product image on the right (responsive stacking on mobile).
- Add “Problem → Solution”, Benefits (6 cards with exact titles), “What’s Inside / Formula”, “Trust & Quality” (4 badge cards), Testimonials/Reviews (6 cards with ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐), FAQ (6–8 expandable items including the 4 specified questions), and Final CTA sections, each with the specified CTA placement and provided images where required.
- Ensure all “Buy Now” / “Order Now” CTAs share the same orange primary style with darker hover state, and all link exactly to the affiliate URL (including a sticky mobile bottom Buy Now bar).
- Keep the page lightweight and responsive, with consistent image styling (shared border radius, aligned grid, correct section placement).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can scroll a fast, mobile-friendly GutOptim landing page with multiple consistent orange “Buy Now” CTAs that smoothly navigate sections and always redirect to the provided affiliate link, with all specified images displayed in their correct sections.
