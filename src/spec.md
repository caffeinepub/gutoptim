# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the FDA-related product disclaimer paragraph from the GutOptim landing page footer while keeping the rest of the footer intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Delete the footer paragraph that begins with “Disclaimer: These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration...”.
- Preserve the existing copyright line and the “Built with … caffeine.ai” attribution link.
- Adjust footer spacing if needed so there is no awkward empty gap where the disclaimer was.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page footer no longer shows the disclaimer text, but still shows the copyright and caffeine.ai attribution link with clean spacing.
